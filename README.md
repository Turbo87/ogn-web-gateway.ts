OGN APRS to REST/WS Gateway

This project contains a webserver written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
that connects to the [OGN](http://wiki.glidernet.org/) (Open Glider Network)
and relays the data to all connected WebSocket clients. It also provides a
small REST API to query historical data from the past 24 hours.

This project is **work in progress**, and much of the above is not
implemented yet.
